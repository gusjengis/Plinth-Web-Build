This npm package is part of my Plinth stack (See example at [Plinth-Hello-World](https://github.com/gusjengis/Plinth-Hello-World).)

This package exports two commands:

### plinth-build

This handles building a Plinth project.

### plinth-dev

This boots a hot-reloading dev server.

## Requirements

These scripts expect you to have a project that uses the full Plinth stack, which includes [Plinth-Core](https://github.com/gusjengis/Plinth-Core) and [Plinth-Web](https://github.com/gusjengis/Plinth-Web).

Again, see [Plinth-Hello-World](https://github.com/gusjengis/Plinth-Hello-World) for an example of how this is expected to be set up.
